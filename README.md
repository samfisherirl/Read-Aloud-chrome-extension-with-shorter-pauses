# Read Aloud Chrome & Edge extension Fork

## Read-Aloud Chrome & Edge extension with shorter, more natural pauses. 

This is a fork from the original and they get all of the credit.  https://github.com/ken107/read-aloud  

This fork has been created to remove the pauses between periods and line breaks that are too long for someone who listens at faster speeds. The pauses have been reduced by 75%, which makes the extension much more natural sounding. I use the extension for everything. While, I listen to most things at 2x speed, I found myself increasing the speed just to remove pausing between each period and line break. This lead to me scowering the source code for pause variables. I'll try to keep this updated with the parent branch as best I can.
