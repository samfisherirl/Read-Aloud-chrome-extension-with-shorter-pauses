# Read Aloud Chrome extension Fork

Read-Aloud Chrome extension with shorter, more natural pauses. This is a fork from the original and they get all of the credit.  https://github.com/ken107/read-aloud  

This fork has been created to remove the pauses that are too long in the original version of the extension. The pauses have been reduced by 75%, which makes the extension much more natural sounding. I use the extension for everything. While I listen to most things at 2x speed, I found myself increasing the speed just to remove pausing between each period and line break. This lead to me scowering the source code for pause variables.
